## Project
This is a sample project that presents a showcase how to combine
several useful technologies together:

1. ```Mybatis``` instead of ```JPA```-based technologies
2. ```TestContainers``` with ```MySQL```
3. ```Spring Security```

## Intention
Since the intention is to test things, rather than deliver a working
application, there's **no application code** in the project, only 
some unit/integration tests
